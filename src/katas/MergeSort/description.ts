export const description = `Merge Sort

    In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. 
    Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.
    Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.
